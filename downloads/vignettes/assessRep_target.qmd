title: "Target-Based Representation Analysis on Conservation Areas using Proportional Representation"

## Intro

Representation analyses typically include multiple layers assumed to represent a range of ecological processes. They often include climate layers, productivity, riparian zones etc.  a target-based approach using proportional representation. This is useful when you want to ensure specific target areas of different representation classes are met in one or multiple conservation areas.

The goal of the representation analysis is to identify conservation areas that adequately capture the target amounts of representation classes (in our case NALC classes) deemed to be proportionally representative of the study region. Usually the target amounts should be met in full in a conservation area, rather than being split between multiple conservation areas. The idea being that the conservation area should provide a sufficient area for the ecological processes associated with specific target classes to operate. In a network of multiple conservation areas, different target classes and different ecological processes may therefore be represented by different conservation areas.

For this example we will use a single layer (NALC) to assess representation of the 13 land cover classes that fall within our study area. The study area is a Fundamental Drainage Area in Yukon, Canada (FDA 09EA).
