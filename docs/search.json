    "text": "Welcome to the BEACONs tools pages!\nThe BEACONs Project was founded at the University of Alberta in recognition for a new approach to conservation planning in North Americaâ€™s boreal region. We are building a credible scientific framework for comprehensive conservation planning through the development and application of leading-edge conservation science that includes consideration of both protected areas and lands managed for other values. The premise of our research is that the ultimate goal of conservation is to identify human activities that are compatible with the maintenance of biological diversity and integrity of ecological systems. The conceptual scientific framework guiding our research is the Conservation Matrix Model.\nWithin these pages we provide information on the data, methods, and tools that we use for large-scale conservation planning in the boreal region, including:\n\nR/Shiny apps to assist in conservation planning and assessment.\nR packages to facilitate large scale conservation planning.\nDocumentation describing the data, methods, and tools.\nResources such as bookmarks, presentations, and supporting material from publications.\n\n\nShiny Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeopackage Creator\nDisturbance Explorer\nHydrology Explorer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation Area Explorer\n\nWolverine Survey Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Apps (under development)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisturbance Validation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Packages\n\n\n\nbeaconstools\nbeaconsbuilder\nbeaconshydro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n |   |   |\n\nDocumentation pages\n\n\n\nBEACONs Docs\nDisturbance Mapping\nConnectivity Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n |   |   |"
