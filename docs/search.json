Those functions have been group into categories. This pages aims to document each function and demonstrate their use through example. The functions are target advanced users who work with environmental data at large scale."

It prepares inputs, runs the external executable, and returns the main output table.\n\n\n\nPrepares input tables: neighbours, seeds, and catchments.\nWrites files to a temp directory (or output_dir if provided).\nConstructs a command to run BUILDER via system().\nReturns the *_COLUMN_All_Unique_BAs.csv file listing conservation areas and their catchments.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns a tibble of conservation area names and associated catchments.\nIf output_dir is provided, additional BUILDER output tables (e.g., hydrology, summary metrics) are saved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nArea target\nSet in the seeds table; minimum size (m²) for each conservation area.\n\n\nCatchment intactness\nMinimum intactness required for catchments to be included.\n\n\nConservation area intactness\nMinimum area-weighted intactness for a conservation area to be returned.\n\n\nArea target proportion\nAllows output of smaller areas (e.g., 0.9 returns areas &gt;= 90% of the area target).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse output_dir to preserve BUILDER’s complete outputs when running multiple builds.
