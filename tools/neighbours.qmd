## BUILDER R Functions

# `neighbours()` 

The `neighbours()` function creates a **neighbours table** listing neighbours for each catchment, which is an input to `builder()`.  

For an sf object of catchments with unique CATCHNUM id's, calculates a list of neighbouring CATCHNUM pairs
and returns them in a long tibble. Neighbours are defined as having at least on point in common (within 0.1m).


## Usage

```r
neighbours(
  catchments_sf
)
```
## Arguments

- catchments_sf: sf object of the catchments dataset with a unique identifier column: CATCHNUM.


## ðŸ“¤ Output
A tibble of neighbouring pairs with columns **CATCHNUM** and **neighbours**.


## Examples
### Running the examples

1. Download and unzip BEACONs R Tools 

2. Create the folder structure
```r
# Set working directory
setwd("your/path/to/downloads")

dirpath <- getwd()

# Create the folder structure
treedir <- c("R","data","Builder_input")
for(d in treedir){
  if (!dir.exists(file.path(dirpath, d))) {
    dir.create(file.path(dirpath, d), recursive = TRUE)
  }
}
```

3. Run the examples below.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(utils)

source("./R/builder.R")

# Use all catchments as seeds with a single area target
catchments_sample <- readRDS("data/catchments_sample.rds")
neighbours(catchments_sf = catchments_sample)

# save neighbours as csv
neighbour <- neighbours(catchments_sf = catchments_sample)
write.csv(neighbour, file=file.path(dirpath,"Builder_input/neighbours.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
```
