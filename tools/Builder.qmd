**BEACONs Builder**

beaconsbuilder allows you to build conservation areas following rules of size, intactness, and hydrological connectivity. You can visit the package website here: https://beaconsproject.github.io/beaconsbuilder.

beaconsbuilder should be used together with the beaconstools package to construct and analyse sets of conservation areas. More details on how beaconsbuilder works can be found in vignette("builder").

**BEACONs Builder has 4 main functions:**

- [seeds](Builder/seeds.qmd)
- [reserve_seeds](Builder/reserve_seeds.qmd)
- [neighbours](Builder/neighbours.qmd)
- [builder](Builder/builder.qmd)
