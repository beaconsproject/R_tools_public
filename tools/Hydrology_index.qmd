## BEACONs Hydrology R Functions
BEACONs developped a range of hydrology functions for adding ecological attributes to conservation areas, such as identifying all watershed catchments upstream (or downstream) and calculates their area and intactness values and calculating hydrological connectivity within each conservation area or network.

**The 4 main hydrology functions are:**

- [calc_dci](calc_dci.qmd)
- [calc_lwdci](calc_lwdci.qmd)
- [get_upstream_catchments](get_upstream_catchments.qmd)
- [get_downstream_catchments](get_downstream_catchments.qmd)

### calc_dci

The function [calc_dci()](dci.qmd) calculate dendritic connectivity index (DCI) for a set of conservation areas, which quantifies the “longitudinal connectivity of river networks based on the expected probability of an organism being able to move freely between two random points of the network” (Cote et al. 2009).

### calc_lwdci 

The function [calc_lwdci()](dci.qmd) calculate stream network length-weighted dendritic connectivity index (DCI) for a set of input polygons.It emphasizes the impact of fragmentation on streams, due to a lack of connection (different ocean drainage or loss of connectivity due to disturbances), giving a more realistic picture of how much of the functional network remains connected for species movement.

### get_upstream_catchments 
The function [get_upstream_catchments()](get_upstream_catchments.qmd) calculates the area upstream of a given polygon using catchments and stream flow attributes.

### get_downstream_catchments
The function [get_downstream_catchments()](get_downstream_catchments.qmd) calculates the area downstream of a given polygon using catchments and stream flow attributes.
